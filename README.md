##What is JAMM: Advancing Through Time?

Just Another Modded Minecraft (JAMM) Advancing Through Time; is a modpack focused on different ages throughout the history. It's progression-based gameplay will let you experience to live from primitive prehistoric ages to the more advanced atomic age.

Do quests/tasks to progress with different eras and other branches like farming, sailing, etc. Multiple structure mods are included in the mod so it's also great to explore and do some adventures. Be aware of hostile mobs and bosses though as they are also lurking throughout the world. Designed to be played for both alone or in a multiplayer environment.

It's kind of harder to play cause all of the items are staged by their respective stages, but not that hard that you won't enjoy it anymore.  And... much, much more!

*It's the first modpack that I made where I poured so much effort into. Staging the items, recipes, and dimensions. Setting up quests, creating simple mods to cater my needs. It's not perfect, I know, but I hope you will enjoy it!*
